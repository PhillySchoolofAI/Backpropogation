###  Tools 
* Anaconda (Version >5.0, python version 3.x)
	* **About**
		* Anaconda is a distribution of packages built for data science. 
		* It comes with conda, a package and environment manager. 
		* You can use conda to create environments for isolating your projects that use different versions of Python and/or different packages.
	* **Installation**
		* [For Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows)
		* [For MacOS](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)
		* [For Linux](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux)
	* Click [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/) if you’re interested in the documentation
	* To understand how to use anaconda please visit this [site](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/k)
	* For environment creation and management please go through [this link](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). Get a gist of the basics required for installation and management of environments. 
		* If you prefer videos. [This](https://youtu.be/EGaw6VXV3GI) provides a very good summary for you to follow. 
* [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
	* This is a very interactive tool of learning and teaching python programming. 
	* Good thing is, it comes preinstalled with anaconda. So you don’t have to install anything else.
